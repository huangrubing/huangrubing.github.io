			<p align="justify">His current research interests include: <font color="red">1) AI for Software Engineering</font>, i.e., adopting AI knowledge and techniques to support the development of software engineering (including software requirements, testing, debugging, and maintenance); <font color="red">2) Software Engineering for AI</font>, i.e., applying the principles of software engineering to AI systems (such as AI systems testing and debugging); <font color="red">3) Failure-based testing</font>, i.e., taking advantage of the knowledge of software failures to support the testing process; and <font color="red">4) Testing of complex software systems such as IoT systems, intelligent systems, and autonomous driving systems</font>. </p>				
			<p align="justify"><strong><font color="coral">I am looking for highly motivated Ph.D./MPhil students with strong backgrounds in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Programming. Undergraduate students who are interested in my research areas are also warmly welcome to join us as research assistants. Please feel free to contact me via email at the page bottom.</font></strong></p>
			
			<p align="justify"><strong><font color="blue" fontStyle="italic">The basic requirements for students are listed as follows: 1) For Ph.D. candidates, when giving a research paper or a research direction, you can do the following work, i.e., Reading and understanding research papers --> Finding potential issues --> Proposing your new ideas --> Implementing your ideas --> Conducting experiments to validate your ideas --> Collecting and analyzing experimental results --> Writing a research paper to summarize your findings; 2) For MPhil candidates, if you can do Ph.D. candidates' work, it would be great; otherwise, you should at least do the following work based on a given research idea, i.e.,  Implementing the given idea --> Conducting experiments to validate the given idea --> Collecting and analyzing experimental results --> Writing a research report. </font><em><font color="red">A friendly reminder: If you do not satisfy these requirements, I can discuss with you how to do the research work; however, if you do not want to have a try, please reconsider your decision. Thank you.</font></em></strong></p>		</div>
